This is a development version of Shashin 3.

You must also install the toppa-libs plugin to use Shashin 3.

Information about the current stable release, Shashin 2, is here:
http://www.toppa.com/shashin-wordpress-plugin/

This version currently has only a working admin menu, for adding Shashin
albums. The options menu is not built yet, and the tags are not
implemented yet.

 Shashin 3 is a total rewrite from previous versions. Album syncing
 is done in a new and more efficient way. Testing of the syncing is
 appreciated. If you encounter a problem, please submit an issue
 ticket at https://github.com/toppa/Shashin/issues
