This is a development version of Shashin 3 and is subject to
ongoing major changes.

Information about the current stable release, Shashin 2, is here:
http://www.toppa.com/shashin-wordpress-plugin/

IMPORTANT: When downloading from GitHub, rename the folder to
shashin3alpha before uploading to your WordPress plugin directory.

ALSO IMPORTANT: install the toppa-libs plugin before installing this one,
as it contains required libraries: https://github.com/toppa/toppa-libs/

GitHub contains the latest revisions of code for this project, which may
not always be thoroughly tested.

This version currently has only a working admin menu, for adding Shashin
albums. The options menu is not built yet, and the tags are not
implemented yet.

Shashin 3 is a total rewrite from previous versions. Album syncing
is done in a new and more efficient way. Testing of the syncing is
appreciated. If you encounter a problem, please submit an issue
ticket at https://github.com/toppa/Shashin/issues
